USing mySQL simulate the sales activity of a direct sales company and using python to visualize the progress 
The goal of this project is to apply the knowledge learned from the IE6700 course to a real-world business case. In this project, we simulate the operations of a direct sales company, focusing on how data systems can support sales and recruitment. The main purpose is to help the company owner, managers, and employees get a clear and organized view of how the business is runningâ€”especially in terms of tracking agent activities, order statuses, and onboarding progress. A well-structured database system can reduce confusion, improve accuracy, and support better decision-making. Instead of relying on Excel sheets or messaging apps, which can easily cause errors or data loss, we aim to build a system that is more reliable and efficient for daily use.
There are four major steps in this project. First, we design the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram and UML model based on how the company operates in real life. These diagrams help us understand the relationships between departments, employees, orders, and customers. Second, we build the relational model by identifying primary keys, foreign keys, and other important constraints that maintain data consistency. In the third step, we write Python scripts to generate sample data that mimics real company data. We then use this data to build the database schema in MySQL. At the same time, we also store the data in MongoDB to show how it can be represented in a NoSQL format. Finally, we connect both databases to Python, run queries, and create visualizations like plots and charts to show useful insights, such as agent performance or order progress.
The final database system allows managers to easily monitor the daily activities of sales agents. They can use the information to give agents specific feedback, suggest better sales locations, or improve training. For the company owner and other employees, the system provides an easy way to keep track of agent onboarding and customer orders. This helps reduce chargebacks caused by early cancellations and improves overall company performance. With better data organization and reporting, the company can make smarter decisions and run more smoothly.
